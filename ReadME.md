# âš¡ Spice-Wingman

**Spice-Wingman** is an AI-powered tool that leverages **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** to automatically optimize analog circuit parameters in **LTspice**. Built with students and engineers in mind, it simplifies the traditionally manual, trial-and-error process of tuning circuit values.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- âœ… Automatic optimization of netlist parameters (resistors, capacitors, voltages)
- âœ… RL model trained to improve gain, reduce power dissipation
- âœ… Supports **AC** and **Transient** analysis
- âœ… Web-based interface for uploading circuits and visualizing results
- âœ… Before-and-after comparison of performance metrics

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement

Tuning analog circuit parameters in LTspice is:
- Time-consuming  
- Non-optimal  
- Difficult to scale for complex designs

## ðŸ§  Our Solution

We designed an **RL agent** that:
- Takes user-submitted LTspice netlists
- Iteratively adjusts key parameters
- Outputs optimized circuits with measurable improvements
